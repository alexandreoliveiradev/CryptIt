# Crypt iT

Hello and welcome to Crypt iT.

Crypt iT is a wep application designed to encrypt and decrypt your texts for a safer communication. 
This is a small project to help understand a bit more of React, Javascript, CSS and Html.

Hope you can use this application, that is going to be under development in the incoming times.

Cheers, Alex
