# Crypt iT

Hello and welcome to Crypt iT.

Crypt iT is a wep application designed to encrypt and decrypt your texts for a safer communication. 
This is a small project to help understand a bit more of React, Javascript, CSS and Html.

For now, the application is not yet hosted anywhere, so:
#### prerequisites
 [NODE](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your computer
 
 open your command line
 
 cd into cryptic directory
 
 perform npm install
 
 perform npm start

Hope you can use this application, that is going to be under development in the incoming times.

Cheers, Alex
